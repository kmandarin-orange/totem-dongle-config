# TOTEM 38-Key Split Keyboard Config

This is my keymap for my build of the great [TOTEM split keyboard](https://github.com/GEIGEIGEIST/TOTEM?tab=readme-ov-file), running [modified firmware](https://github.com/eigatech/zmk-config/tree/totem-dongle) to support a wireless dongle setup. Still evolving somewhat, but it's begun to stabilize (except for a possible, future switch to a Colemak-DH layout o_O)
